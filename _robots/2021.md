For the 2021 FRC season, Team 4099 built our robot, Merlin. Due to the pandemic, Merlin wasn't able to compete in any events, but was able to compete in Infinite Recharge At Home events. Despite the challenges brought on the the pandemic, we managed to safely construct one of our most complex robots ever.
