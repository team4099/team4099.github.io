For the 2022 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Kestrel. We participated two district events, both held in Washington DC. We ranked 4th, won the Industrial Design Award, and were event finalists at our first event and ranked 7th, won the Autonomous Award, and reached the semifinals at our second event. This excellent performance propelled us to District Championships in Hampton, VA, where our robot soared to the semifinals, ranking 4th, and earning the Autonomous Award again, securing us a spot at the World Championship. Then, in our most brilliant season yet, our masterful defense contributed to our alliance's win at the Turing Division, ultimately bringing us to the World Championship finals! Following this exceptional season, we were invited to the exclusive Indiana Robotics Invitational off-season event, and our alliance won the whole event!
