For the 2022 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Kestrel. We went to two district events, both held in Washington DC, winning second place with our alliance, advancing us to District Championships in Hampton, VA and earning us the Industrial Design and Autonomous awards. In Virginia, our robot continued on its warpath to victory, making it to semifinals while again earning us the Autonomous Award, securing us a spot in the World Championships. Then, in our most brilliant season thus far, our robot won the Turing division and made it to finals in the Einstein Division.
