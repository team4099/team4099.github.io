competition_summary: |
    In Charged Up, two competing alliances are invited to process cubes and cones to bring energy to their community. Each alliance brings energy to their community by retrieving their game pieces from substations and scoring it into the grid. Human players provide the game pieces to the robots from the substations. In the final moments of each match, alliance robots race to dock or engage with their charge station.

For the 2023 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Zapdos. We participated in two district events, winning the Innovation in Controls Award and the whole event in Bethesda, MD, and advancing to the semifinals and winning the Creativity Award in Alexandria, VA. These achievements propelled us to the District Championship in Fairfax, VA, where Sarah Yu, one of our dedicated team members, was honored as a FIRST Dean's List Finalist! Our electrifying  performance in the Chesapeake District secured us a spot at the World Championship. For the first time in our team's history, we were the first pick in the playoffs at the World Championship and ranked 11th in the Newton Division!
