For the 2024 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Nightingale. We participated in two district events, becoming event finalists in Ashland, VA, advancing to the quarterfinals in Owings Mills, MD, and earning the Quality Award at both of these events. From there, we soared to the District Championship in Petersburg, VA, reaching new heights, as we had our best District Championship performance in our team history. Here, we captained Alliance 2 and reached the semifinals! It was also here that, Pranav Karthikeyan, one of our excellent student leaders, was honored as a FIRST Deanâ€™s List Finalist. This outstanding performance secured us a spot in the World Championship, where we ranked 64th in the Curie division. In the off-season, we put our robot to the ultimate test at WVROX, a 26-hour-long endurance event, and came out as quarterfinalists! We continued our momentum by winning the Battle o' Baltimore event with our new drive team, ending the Crescendo off-season on a high note!
