<p>In FalconMath, middle and high school students will be able to learn high school level math courses that 
    can help them in the upcoming school year. Each session is one-week long and consists of daily two-hour classes.
     Under the guidance of members of Team 4099 who have already taken these courses, students will be able to engage in
      lessons and confidently prepare for the upcoming school year.
</p>
<p>There are a total of four sessions over the course of two weeks: two weeks of Geometry and two weeks of Algebra 2/Precalculus.
     Geometry will be taught in the morning while Algebra 2/Precalculus will be taught in the afternoon. Read further for more
      information about the camp and each course.

       Camps will be held every day over a Zoom call. Geometry sessions will be from 10:00AM to 12:00PM, while Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus sessions will be from 1:00PM to 3:00PM. Counselors will also have office hours
       where campers can ask questions. More information about joining sessions will be sent one week before your
       selected session(s).
       The registration fee for two weeks is $200. If you refer a friend who signs up (indicated during
       their registration process),
       you will receive a $20 refund!
       <!-- In addition to the registration fee and sign up, the Online Communication and Media Consent form must be
       completed and can
       be found <a href="/files/2023FalconCampsCommunicationsMediaConsentForm.pdf">here</a>.If you would like financial support, 
       please fill out the form found <a href="/files/2023FalconCampsScholarshipApplicationForm.pdf" >here</a> and email it to
       <a href="mailto:falconcamps@team4099.com">falconcamps@team4099.com</a> for approval
       Our refund policy is as follows: if you withdraw your registration two weeks prior to the course, you will get a full
       refund. Withdrawing one week prior will give you a $60 refund. Anything sooner to the start date of your course will not
       allow for a refund.-->

       FAQ
   </div>
</div>
<div class="row" id="faqContainer mt-3">
   <div class="col">
       <p class="accordion">Q: Who are the camp instructors?
       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: The camp counselors are members of the FIRST Robotics Competition team, 
        Team 4099 and are all high school magnet students. All instructors have mastery over the content
        they are teaching.

       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q. Who is FalconMath meant for?
       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: FalconMath is meant for middle to high school students who are looking for a thorough, 
        guided review of Geometry or Algebra 2/Pre-Calculus so that they can be fully prepared to take the class the 
        following school year or be placed into a higher math class.

       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q: What will a typical schedule look like?

       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: Each day will begin with a warmup and objective led by one counselor. 
        Students will then be broken into small groups where students will learn the content from one 
        to two counselors and be able to engage via practice problems. Students will then return as a 
        whole group for the conclusion of the day.
       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q: Are there any prerequisites for the camp?

       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: Students are expected to have completed math courses through Algebra 1 in 
        school. Our lessons teach these subjects starting from the fundamentals so that students can learn 
        the majority of the subject just from our camp.
       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q: My child is interested in FalconMath, but cost is an issue.
       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: If the $100 tuition is a barrier to you for registration, we welcome you to apply for a
         full scholarship by emailing the scholarship application form to <a href="mailto:falconmath@team4099.com">falconmath@team4099.com</a>. Team 4099’s goal is 
         to help students and teams learn, regardless of economic circumstances.

       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q: What sets FalconMath apart from online resources?

       </p>
       <div class="panel">A:  There’s a couple of things that set FalconMath apart

               <li>First, FalconMath provides live teaching and guidance which can be tailored for your child's needs at 
                that time as we have an average 2:1 ratio of students to counselors.
               </li>
               <li> Secondly, FalconMath provides fun, engaging interactive activities to help students master the content of 
                lessons.
               </li>
               <li>Thirdly, FalconMath focuses on developing a deep, conceptual understanding of math rather than just basic 
                memorization 
               </li>
               <li>Finally, FalconMath is taught by current high school magnet students who all have a high proficiency in math and 
                relevant knowledge on the subjects they’re teaching
               </li>
           </ul>
       </div>

       <!--<p class="accordion">Q: How do refunds work?
       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: Refunds differ based on how long in advance you are canceling:
           <ul>
               <li>
                   If you are withdrawing 2 weeks in advance, you will get a full refund.
               </li>
               <li>
                   If you are withdrawing 1 week in advance, you will get $35 back.
               </li>
               <li>
                   If you are withdrawing less than 1 week in advance, we do not offer refunds.
               </li>
           </ul>
       </div>-->

       <p class="accordion">Q: I am a mentor on an FRC team, but want to learn more about design/programming through
           these
           camps. Can I sign up?
       </p>
       <div class="panel">A: Sure! We do not have a maximum age for the camps.
       </div>

       <p class="accordion">Q: What sets these camps apart from online resources and workshops put out by FIRST teams?
       </p>
       <div class="panel">
           A: There’s a couple of things that set FalconCamps apart.
           <br />
           <br />

           First, the learning environment is more structured, which
           works better for many students. Many students have a harder time learning from random videos found on
           YouTube and the
           occasional post on online forums than they do with one-on-one discussion. FalconCamps offers a more
           structured,
           personalized learning experience.
           <br />
           <br />


           Secondly, Team 4099 has found that while there are plenty of online resources for advanced level
           learning
           for FRC
           concepts, there is a lot of content missing for students at the beginner and intermediate concepts who
           may,
           for example,
           have never used CAD software before.
           <br />
           <br />

           Team 4099 greatly appreciates all of the content that is out there and is freely available for use by
           all
           teams (many of
           our team members learned from these resources). FalconCamps act as a supplement, rather than a
           replacement,
           for this
           content.
