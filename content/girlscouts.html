        <h3>An Overview Of RoboBadge</h3>
        <p>
            Scouts will get the opportunity to earn their robotics badges (Programming Robots, Designing Robots, Showcasing
            Robots)! This event is open to all Brownies, Juniors, and Cadettes of Girl Scouts. Team 4099 will have their students on site as
            volunteers who will teach and assist the students.

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
            Team 4099 is a World Championship attending FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based out of Poolesville High School.
            We apply our knowledge of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) to build a robot for a challenge given by
            the FIRST Robotics Competition. Students not only partake in the competition aspect of the team, but also focus on
            spreading STEM and robotics awareness in their communities. Team 4099 strives to create an inclusive learning community
            where students can learn and apply their knowledge in STEM to real-world problems.
