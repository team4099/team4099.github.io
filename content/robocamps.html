        <p>
            During RoboCamps, elementary and middle school students, ages 8-14, will learn and devleop math,
            engineering, and computer science skills
            in the context of competitive robotics in an interactive and friendly environment.
            This year, RoboCamps will be hosted online over Zoom, but students will still have the chance to physically
            build at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            RoboCamps will consist of five online sessions, each five hours long, with a lunch break in between.
            Campers will
            work with the help of their counselors, including mentors, subteam leads, and veterans, to construct a
            robotics kit that they receive from Poolesville High School.
            Throughout the course, campers will obtain the invaluable skills of designing, building, and coding a simple
            robot, as well as receive the
            feeling of accomplishment from watching it successfully run for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We offer both beginner and intermediate RoboCamps sessions, so there is a program for everyone. Read further
            to learn more about the material being taught in these respective camps.

                        This session allows campers to build and program a basic VEX IQ robot from the comfort of their own home. 
                        Campers will learn about block code, sensors, and more to enable their robot to complete a challenge. 
                        At the end of the week, campers will participate in a virtual competition!

        Camps will be held every day in the session over a Zoom call. Sessions 
        will be held from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM with a 1 hour lunch break in between. Counselors will also have office hours
        where campers can ask questions. More information about joining sessions will be sent 1 week before your
        selected session.
        The VEX robotics kits
        that will be used during these sessions must be picked up one week prior to the start of your course at the church near Poolesville High School. As the date gets closer, emails will be sent out 
        regarding specific times. 
        The registration fee for one week is $175 plus a $20 deposit that we will return to you once you have returned the kit to the team.
        If you refer a friend who signs up for our camps (indicated during
        the registration process),
        your price goes down to $165!
        In addition to the registration fee and sign up, the Online Communication and Media Consent form must be
        completed and can
        be found <a href="/files/Online Communication and Media Consent Form.pdf" download>here</a> as well as the liability form
        which can be found <a href="/files/RoboCamps Liability form.pdf">here</a>. If you would like financial support,
        please fill out the form found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C562TcU--ail-1JpppRFgx2H0_icaJCyaD7EGKAl944/edit" >here</a>. Please email all forms to
        <a href="mailto:robocamps@team4099.com">robocamps@team4099.com</a> after registering. 
        Our refund policy is as follows: if you withdraw your registration two weeks prior to the course, you will get a full
        refund. Withdrawing one week prior will give a $60 refund. Anything sooner to the start date of your course will not
        allow for a refund.

    <div class="col">
        <p class="accordion">Q: Who are the camp instructors?
        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: The camp instructors will consist of adult mentors as well as student members of Team
            4099. All instructors have mastery over the content they are teaching.
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q. How is this different than in-person RoboCamps?
        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we unfortunately cannot run RoboCamps in person this year due to
            social distancing and health risks. Although, we still have the program available, it will just be online. Students 
            will be able to pick up kits from Poolesville High and build their own robot at home. They will be mentored online 
            over Zoom. The kits will still have to be returned.
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: What will a RoboCamps session look like?

        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: Sessions will have 10 participants. The session opens with an interactive
            lecture led by a mentor or counselor, where everybody is able to ask questions. We then break up into groups
            of 4 students and 1
            counselor, where students ask questions, do interactive work designed to hone the skills taught in the
            lecture,
            and discuss in a small group.
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: Who are RoboCamps meant for?

        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: RoboCamps are meant for older elementary school aged students and above who want to get started with robotics, design or programming. 
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: My child has no experience with robotics, or programming. Can they still
            participate?
        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: Yes! Our camp is geared towards students of all ages and all experience levels. There are no specific prerequisites, but make sure your camper is comfortable with most of the beginner topics before they sign up for a intermediate session.
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: I am interested in attending RoboCamps, but cost is an issue.

        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: We understand that during the current economic situation, the $175 cost may be difficult
            for
            some to pay. If cost is
            a barrier to you for registration, please email us and we can discuss options. Team 4099’s goal is to help
            children and
            teams learn, regardless of economic circumstances.
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: How do refunds work?
        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: Refunds differ based on how long in advance you are canceling:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you are withdrawing 2 weeks in advance, you will get a full refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are withdrawing 1 week in advance, you will get $60 back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are withdrawing less than 1 week in advance, we do not offer refunds.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="accordion">Q: Will you ship the kits to the students?
        </p>
        <div class="panel">A: Unfortunately during this time we are not able to. You can pick up your kit the week prior to the first course at the church near Poolesville High School.
